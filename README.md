# basic-nn-xor
A basic feed-forward nn to approximate an xor gate.

Hello all!

This is my first attempt at creating a neural network. I'll try to make the most basic one I can think of in order to get familiar with all the maths.

I'll try and explain in detail what I did, so hopefully some of you find it useful in your own endevours.

# Notes
I used these resources when making this (in case you also find them useful):
