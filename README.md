# A basic feed-forward nn approximating an xor gate

Hello all!

This is my first attempt at creating a neural network. I made the most basic one I could think of in order to get familiar with all the maths. Hopefully some of you find this example useful in your own endevours.

### Prequisites
- Basic multi-var calculus
- Linear algebra

### So what is this neural network you speak of?

A neural network is basically a function approximator that is crudely modeled on the interconnections neurons interface with inside our brains. Through some funky maths, they are able to approximate pretty much any continuous function.
